# Darknet Markets Analysis & Business Intelligence
In my undergraduate honor thesis of darknet markets analysis and business intelligence, I investigate the relation between sellers' lisitngs similarities and sellers' levels. 
This project includes a program in Python programming language which parses 13,828 sample web pages using regular expression. And all similarities scores of each pair of sellers are calculated using dov2vec which is an advanced algorithm used to classify text. The parsed and calculated data are used for the calculation of correlation between sellers' similarities and seller levels. 
## The final result shows that there is no relation between sellers' listings similarities and seller levels.

### Situation (S): 
At Mayo Clinic's Health Sciences Research lab in Scottasdale, a gradute student wants a website to display his Ras-Signaling project for academic publications. But he is not able to do so because of unfamiliarity with web design. 
### Task (T): 
My goal is to create an interactive website of Ras Signaling that would help the project publication by saving researchers/pubilshers' time to navigate the project instead of reading through the long paper. 
### Action (A): 
I design a new web page to by studying online libraries for web design, such as GOJS, a JavaScript library for implementing custom interactive diagrams and data visualizations (ref. https://gojs.net/latest/index.html). However, it doesn't work well for this project because it requires high-level customization. So I choose to write pure JavaScript code to define various links and nodes. Also, I use PhotoShop to move the links explanation to the top so it shows details by hovering mouse. I update the project once the graduate student has updated data/requirements. To make it easy for the gradute student, I use NodeJS to convert the shared Excel sheets data into JSON data so he can focus on spreadsheets without worring about web design.  
### Result (R):
The graduate student and lab leader are satisfied with my work which is an innovative way to display complex biomedical projects with dragable and clickable noeds, various types of links and other functionalities. This website is ahead of the paper publication date in July.
