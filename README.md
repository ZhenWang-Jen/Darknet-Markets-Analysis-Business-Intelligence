## Darknet Markets Analysis for Business Intelligence
My undergraduate honor thesis of darknet markets analysis and business intelligence. 
This study investigates the relation between sellers' lisitngs similarities and seller levels. 
This project includes a program in Python programming language which parses 13,828 sample web pages using regular expression. And all similarities scores of each pair of sellers are calculated using dov2vec which is an advanced algorithm used to classify text. The parsed and calculated data are used for the calculation of correlation between sellers' similarities and seller levels. 
#The final result shows that there is no relation between sellers' listings similarities and seller levels.
